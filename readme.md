This sample application show's Contextual SDK for both no-code and low code use-cases.

# No Code

2. Install the Contextual SDK snippet by following the instructions in Setttings->Installation->Web.
3. During this process, it will also install the Contextual Creator (Chrome Extension)

# Extensibility (Low Code)

Like something Contextual doesnâ€™t offer in our Standard Components? Contextual provide a powerful capability to use your favourite open source components or even your own in-App elements as part of Guides. We call these "GuideBlocks".


## Fancy Announcement

<table>
<tr>
<td style="width:60%">
In this example, we show how to make a Fancy Announcement, just like the crazy ones your Designer comes up with ðŸ¤£. Its a simple example to get you started with Contextual Extensibility without needing to hard-code your changes every time you want to update the tip.

To use in your App, [follow the instructions](https://github.com/GuideBlocks-org/iOS-GuideBlocks/blob/confetti/Sources/iOS-GuideBlocks/FancyAnnouncement/README.md)

<td style="width:40%">

</td>
</tr></table>

## List Row Insertion (AdhocRowInsertion)

The Apps' existing code can be now orchestrated for Product Team to make use of. This powerful but simple example shows how you can add engagement for promotional content in existing app lists without cluttering screen realestate. Do engagement just like Twitter or Facebook does and no need for Appstore releases! (after the initial low code work is done)

This example illustrates how you can extend your existing lists with engagement messaging, inline. Your App developer can add this and with a few lines of code extend your application so that a new row can be targeted to specific users with promotional or explanatory content entered from the Contextual Dashboard - no code!

To use in your App, [follow the instructions](https://github.com/contextu-al/AirBnB-iOS/blob/main/airbnb-main/airbnb-main/Components/CustomGuideBlocks/AdhocRowInsertion/README.md)

## Multiple Choice Survey (MultiSelectSurvey)

This is a terrific example about how complex or very custom use-cases can be deployed and easily used by your Product Team. Its the best of Code and No-code combined! Extend your Apps capabilities once, THEN

* launch once, twice, many times 
* to specific users and
* measure results.
